            [Intro]
            (Last night, all I think about is you)
            (Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
            (Don't wanna, but I think about you)
            (You know that I'm never gonna lose)
            Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
            Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
            Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
            Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in aâ€”
            [Chorus]
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now  
            [Verse 1]
            Usually, I put somethin' on TV
            So we never think about you and me
            But today, I see our reflections clearly
            In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
            You just need a better life than this
            Not this life with your shapeshiftin' friend
            You say it's nothin', but I know it is
            You got the kind of look to make me feel lit  
            [Pre-Chorus]
            I just wanna get you out them clothes
            I just wanna get you all alone
            Left you with a broken heart to sew
            And now I'm stuck in this heat wave, oh  
            [Chorus]
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now  
            [Bridge]
            I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
            When you sleep and smile so comfortable
            I just wish that I could give you that
            That look that's perfectly un-sad
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Heat waves been fakin' me out  
            [Chorus]
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now
            Sometimes, all I think about is you
            Late nights in the middle of June
            Heat waves been fakin' me out
            Can't make you happier now  
            [Outro]
            Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
            Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
            Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
            Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
